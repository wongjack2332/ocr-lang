# Pseudo code Interpreter
- this is an interpreter written in python
- the pseudo code syntax is based on the ocr exam language
- references to the syntax in docs.md

## Installation
- python v3.10+(support for match case)
- no 3rd libraries used
- `git clone https://github.com/wongjack2332/pseudo-interpreter`

## Usage
- run `python ocr_lang.py` for interactive shell
- `python ocr_lang.py [filename]` runs specific file

## disclaimer
- this is unfinished, like REALLY UNFINISHED
- the basics of the language is now implemented
- this thing is hella slow so any suggestions for optimisation is very welcomed
